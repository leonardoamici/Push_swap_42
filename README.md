# Push_swap

Push_swap is a integer sorting program created as part of 42Firenze's core curriculum. This project focuses on implementing a sorting algorithm using a limited amount of possible operations on two simulated stack-like structures.

## Features

- **LIS:** Implementantion of the LIS for the first part of the algorithm.
- **Checker:** Secondary program that checks the output of push_swap and determines if it worked correctly.

## Technologies

- **Programming Language:** the project was fully written in C.
- **Operating System:** Unix-based systems.
